*** External libraries ***
The project is using external libraries:
curl-8.15.0_5-win64-mingw
libsodium-win64
opus-1.5.2
portaudio

All libraries can be dowloaded from their Github pages. To compile F.E.A.R. project sources make "lib" folder:
"\fear\lib"
and place libraries sources in it like this:
"\fear\lib\curl-8.15.0_5-win64-mingw"
"\fear\lib\libsodium-win64"
"\fear\lib\opus-1.5.2"
"\fear\lib\portaudio"

*** Compile order ***
1. For GUI app open "\fear\gui\src\CMakeLists.txt" with Qt Creator and build app or create folder manualy"
"fear\gui\build"
and run from it commands:
"
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ../src/  
make
"
Then go to compiled app folder and execute command:
"windeployqt .\fear_gui.exe"
It will copy all necessary Qt files in folder.

2. To build main project tools make "build" folder:
"fear\build"
In this folder run commands:
"
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
make
"
You will get *.exe files.

3. To make whole project make "bin" folder in GUI build folder. In example
\fear\gui\gui\build\bin\bin
And copy to this folder files:
"
*.exe
cacert.pem
libcurl-x64.dll
updater.conf
"
