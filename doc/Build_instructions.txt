1. For GUI app open "\fear\gui\src\CMakeLists.txt" with Qt Creator and build app
Then go to compiled app folder and execute command:
"windeployqt .\fear_gui.exe"
It will copy all necessary Qt files in folder.

2. To build main project tools make "build" folder:
"fear\build"
In this folder run commands:
"
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
make
"
You will get *.exe files.

3. To make whole project make "bin" folder in GUI build folder. In example
\fear\gui\gui\build\bin\bin
And copy to this folder files:
"
*.exe
cacert.pem
libcurl-x64.dll
updater.conf
"
